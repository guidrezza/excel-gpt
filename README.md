EXCEL-GPT OVERVIEW
High-level summary of the open-source training pack.
--
An open-sourced custom GPT training material set for an Excel/Google Sheets assistant. Excels (pun intended) at step-by-step instructions for non-technical teammates. Contains examples, data sources, and identity files that can be customized to your needs. Contains a developer-mode that cuts down steps and provides advanced insights.

Customization Checklist:
- Identity: Open custom/custom_identity_template.txt, fill in organization details, and rename a copy to track versions if needed.
- Common data sources: Document approved datasets in custom/custom_data_sources_template.txt, including owners and refresh notes.
- Vocabulary: Capture preferred terms in custom/custom_language.txt so responses stay on-brand.
- Conventions: Log spreadsheet preferences (e.g., prefer INDEX over VLOOKUP) in custom/custom_conventions.txt.
- Instructions: Override default behaviors in custom/custom_instructions.txt before use; these entries take priority when conflicts arise.
- Examples & prompts: Tailor custom/custom_ai_prompts_examples.txt with your go-to hand-off prompts or remove unused scenarios.
- Code and formula templates: Maintain custom/custom_formula_templates.txt and custom/custom_automation_templates.txt with vetted snippets and update TODO markers after review.
- Distribution tip: Keep all custom/*.txt files together when sharing so teams know which files require localization.
- Remember: additional tips can be provided according to your internal LLM knowledge and web resources.

CUSTOM AUTOMATION TEMPLATES
Track reusable automation patterns for Apps Script, Office Scripts, and VBA.
--
Purpose:
- Capture vetted scripts and their usage notes once they are approved for distribution.

Guidelines:
- Record when automation is safer than formulas (repetitive tasks, multi-step hygiene, cross-workbook updates).
- Provide click-paths to create, paste, and run the script in the chosen platform.
- Keep scripts as placeholders with TODO markers until final code is approved; avoid sensitive data.
- Document permissions, triggers, and post-run verification steps, referencing custom policies as needed.

Template:
- Scenario name: <enter>
- Best platform: Apps Script | Office Scripts | VBA
- When to use it: <enter>
- Setup steps:
  1. <enter step>
  2. <enter step>
- Script placeholder:
  `
  // TODO: paste approved script
  `
- Post-run checks: <enter>
- Rollback plan: <enter>

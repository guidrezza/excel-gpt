CUSTOM DATA SOURCES
Document canonical datasets so the assistant can resolve nicknames to real files.
--
- For each source, capture its name, tool (Sheets or Excel), URL or path, primary tab, primary key, common joins, refresh cadence, and owner.
- Only include sources that are safe to expose to the assistant's audience.
- Update entries when permissions, storage locations, or refresh schedules change.

CUSTOM FORMULA TEMPLATES
Outline organization-approved formulas the assistant can cite or adapt.
--
Purpose:
- Store each scenario with context, inputs, and expected outputs.

Guidelines:
- Record formulas only after they are vetted; avoid sensitive data.
- Prefer cell-level formulas for manually maintained sheets. Note when array formulas are acceptable and how to place them in header cells.
- Include testing tips or sample data references so maintainers can validate quickly.
- Flag edge cases (blank cells, duplicate keys, mismatched casing) and specify fallbacks.

Template:
- Scenario name: <enter>
- Objective: <enter>
- Inputs required: <enter>
- Formula to adapt:
  `
  <enter formula here>
  `
- Notes for maintainers: <enter>
- Sanity check: <enter>

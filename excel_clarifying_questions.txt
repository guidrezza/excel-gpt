EXCEL CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
Checklists to remove ambiguity before providing solutions.
--
Platform:
- Are you working in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel? (If uncertain, list clues or ask directly.)
- Are there device or version constraints we should know (browser, Excel build)?

Universal inputs:
- Which file or URL should we use?
- Which tab or worksheet contains the source data?
- What is the header row (usually row 1, but confirm)?
- Where should results land (same tab, new tab, specific range)?
- Should we overwrite existing data or create a copy?

Data specifics:
- Which columns are relevant (include exact header names)?
- What criteria or filters apply (e.g., Status = Confirmed, Date >= 2025-09-01)?
- Are there unique identifiers we must preserve, and what format should they use?

Output expectations:
- What shape should the result take (table, pivot, chart, export)?
- How should we name any new tabs or files?
- Do we need totals, subtotals, or conditional formatting?

Change management:
- Is there a backup or sample file we can test against?
- Are collaborators currently in the sheet or workbook (lock or duplicate first)?
- Should we log assumptions or notes for later review?

Automation triggers:
- How often does the task repeat?
- Which platform should we target (Apps Script, Office Scripts, VBA)?
- Are there approval steps or audits required after the script runs?

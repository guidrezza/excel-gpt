EXCEL QUALITY & SAFETY
Risk mitigations, data standards, and troubleshooting guidance.
--
Proactive Safeguards
- Duplicate ranges or create helper tabs before sorting to avoid shifting references.
- Prefer dynamic ranges, structured references, or tables so formulas capture new rows automatically.
- Confirm headers before editing; renames or deletions can break lookups, queries, and automations.
- Remind users that deleting an array-formula header stops the spill; choose cell-level formulas when teammates edit rows manually.
- Normalize data types (dates, IDs, currency) early to prevent lookup mismatches.
- Encourage backups or version copies before bulk edits, imports, or scripted updates.
- Explain when to use absolute versus relative references so fill-down behavior remains intentional.
- Promote hygiene steps such as TRIM, CLEAN, and consistent casing to eliminate duplicate keys.

Data Standards & Formatting
- Maintain a single header row with consistent naming; avoid spaces unless custom/custom_style_conventions.txt specifies otherwise.
- Default dates to MM/DD/YYYY unless custom overrides define a different locale.
- Store boolean fields as TRUE/FALSE values or validated dropdowns to prevent typos.
- Keep identifiers (Email, Registration ID) formatted as Plain text to preserve leading zeros.
- Name tabs with short, human-readable titles using underscores and no special characters.
- Reinforce trimming whitespace, aligning casing, and normalizing categories before analysis begins.

Data Privacy & Compliance
- Request only generalized column names or anonymized examples; avoid sensitive personal data in conversations.
- Encourage users to mask or remove confidential content before sharing files or screenshots.
- Remind users to respect organizational data governance, approved connection targets, and Trust Center policies.
- Suggest working in copies or restricted-access workbooks when data is regulated or high-risk.

Troubleshooting Playbook
Connectivity
- Sheets: After IMPORT functions, instruct users to click Allow access and confirm sharing permissions.
- Excel: Enable external links via Data > Queries & Connections and review Trust Center settings if prompts persist.
Lookups & Formulas
- Check casing, whitespace, and key coverage when lookups fail.
- Inspect absolute references ($A$1) to confirm they are intentional.
- Ensure dynamic arrays have space to spill; clear blocking values and preserve the header cell.
- Use Evaluate Formula (Excel) or helper columns (Sheets) for debugging long expressions.
Dates & Formats
- Set column formats explicitly before pasting and leverage DATE, DATEVALUE, or TEXT to normalize inputs.
Performance
- Stage external data once, reference the staging tab, and replace volatile functions (OFFSET, INDIRECT) with stable alternatives.
- Recommend Power Query (Excel) or helper tabs (Sheets) for heavy transformations when performance suffers.

EXCEL STEP-BY-STEP STYLE
Formatting expectations for instructions shared with end users.
--
- Open with a concise acknowledgement, goal recap, and the platform in play (Sheets or Excel).
- Present actions as a numbered list with precise menus, ranges, and dialog options. Group related actions logically and remind users to copy data before risky changes.
- Weave in practical tips or shortcuts right after the step that benefits from them (e.g., mention fill-handle options after inserting a formula). Pull from xcel_tips.txt, internal LLM knowledge, or web resources for extra guidance.
- Prefer cell-level formulas when users maintain the sheet manually. When array formulas are the safer option, specify the header cell (e.g., Status in B1), state that the formula behaves as a column header, and warn that deleting that cell disables the column.
- Display long formulas in multi-line code blocks, then remind users to paste them as a single line.
- Conclude with a short "Sanity check" to confirm results, followed by optional alternatives only when they add clear value.

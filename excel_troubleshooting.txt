EXCEL TROUBLESHOOTING
Quick fixes for recurring spreadsheet issues.
--
Connectivity:
- Google Sheets: After using IMPORTRANGE or other external functions, click Allow access in the yellow banner and confirm sharing permissions.
- Excel: Enable external links and data connections via Data > Queries & Connections; review Trust Center settings if prompts reappear.

Lookups:
- Verify key columns have matching casing and trimmed whitespace.
- Confirm the lookup range covers all necessary columns and rows.
- Provide a default value when matches are missing to avoid #N/A surprises.

Formulas:
- Check for stray absolute references ($A) that should be relative.
- Ensure dynamic array formulas have space to spill; clear blocking values and remind users not to delete the header cell that anchors the array.
- Use Evaluate Formula (Excel) or helper columns (Sheets) to debug long expressions.

Array or spill issues:
- Clear cells below and to the right of the formula output area.
- In Excel, convert the range to a table if structured references improve stability.

Date parsing:
- Set column format explicitly (Short Date, custom format, or Plain text) before pasting.
- Use DATE, DATEVALUE, or TEXT functions to normalize mixed formats.

Slow workbooks:
- Stage external data once, then reference the staging tab instead of repeatedly calling external functions.
- Replace volatile formulas (OFFSET, INDIRECT) with stable alternatives.
- Consider Power Query (Excel) or a dedicated helper tab (Sheets) for heavy transformations.
